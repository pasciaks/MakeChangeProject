## Project requirements


## Make Change (Cash Register)

### Overview

In the cash register we will calculate the amount of change returned to a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered. We will also notify the attendant how many of each type of currency ($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) is needed to make the change for the customer. 

Change will be provided using a combination of the largest bill and coin denominations as possible. 

Denominations that are not used will not be displayed.

*Hint: Mod operator*

#### User Story #1

The user is prompted asking for the price of the item.

#### User Story #2

The user is then prompted asking how much money was tendered by the customer.

#### User Story #3

Display an appropriate message if the customer provided too little money or the exact amount.

#### User Story #4

If the amount tendered is more than the cost of the item, display the number of bills and coins that should be given to the customer. Denominations that are not used will not be displayed.

### Grading

*  meets all stated requirements by the due date, you will receive 1 point.
*  meets most of the stated requirements by the due date, you may receive .5 point.
*  does not meet the stated requirements by the due date, you may receive 0 points.

* Amount: any amount less than 20.00, Tendered: anything greater than amount: correct denominations for correct change.

If the project receives 0 points, resubmission for potential partial credit may, at the discretion of the instructor, be granted. Ignored assignments are given 0 points with no possibility for resubmission.

To turn in a project, you must push it to a GitHub repository named **MakeChangeProject**.  You must include a `README.md` describing how to run your program.
